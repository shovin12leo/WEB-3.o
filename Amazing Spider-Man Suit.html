  <h2>The 2012 suit is a departure from the classic design, with a darker and more textured appearance. The suit features a red and blue color scheme, but with darker tones. 
  The red sections have a detailed web pattern, while the blue sections have a sleek, almost metallic look. <br>The eyes of the mask are smaller and more narrow, giving Spider-Man a more aggressive and streamlined appearance.
<br>  This suit is designed to look more homemade, reflecting Peter Parker's early days as Spider-Man.</h2>
